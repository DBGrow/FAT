[TOC]

# Summary

This standard defines a mineable token standard that takes inspiration from Bitcoin and [EIP-918](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-918).





# Motivation

Address the main caveat of existing FAT standards: Issuance is not trustless. FATIP-0 and FATIP-1 require signatures from the issuing identity to coinbase transaction the initial tokens into existence, after which trade is trustless and decentralized. 

The mineable token standard allows tokens to be distributed trustlessly like in reputable ERC-20 ICO's and other smart contract platforms. This effectively turns the initial coin offering into an initial mining offering (IMO) which anyone can participate in.





# Specification `extends` [FTIP-0](0)

This standard extends upon the Fungible Token Standard ([FTIP-0](0)) for its core functionality.

### Contextual Validation

At the heart of the standard lies the contextual proof of work validation rules for entries on the transaction chain.



#### Proof Of Work Implementation

Participating paties run a [hashcash](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hashcash) algorithm to solve a proof of work problem that increases in difficulty over time, similar to Bitcoin.

In this case the Factom Blockchain is used as a source of randomness and determinism to facilitate an reliable PoW system. Seed material for the problem is provided by Factom.



##### Problem Calculation

The hash to find is calculated in a decentralized way using several fields and parameters:

- `difficulty` - The number of F's to prefix the problem with. From the token's issuance
- `blockInterval` - The interval in Factom blocks for invalidating the PoW problem starting from 0. From the tokens issuance.
- `keyMR` - The key merkle root of Factom for the given block



```
problem = difficulty + keyMR 
problem = 0000000 + d0a5f8048231efd6ddfba469834db6b2efb9c0f505d9e400f5c39e14713139d1
```



Every `blockInterval` blocks a new problem is deterministically calculated by participants.



##### Redemption & Reward

The first participant to solve the current proof of work problem submits a transaction entry with the solution to the Factom blockchain. Valid solutions entitle the participant to send a reward quantity of FAT tokens sent to a public Factoid address of their choice.





# Implementation

## Notes

This approach can also be applied to FAT tokens with somewhat more complexity
