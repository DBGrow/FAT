[TOC]

# Summary

This standard defines how FAT token's Factom Chain ID's and other resources are
derived based on a unique identifier. This standard also defines a basic
hierarchical naming convention used to designate hierarchical resources on the
Factom blockchain using the same derivation method.



# Motivation

A standard convention for storing and locating resources on the Factom blockchain is imperative for interoperability.



# Specification

This standard uses Factom Chain's ExtIDs to deterministically generate a resources chain ID's based on a unique set of hierarchical inputs.



## Hierarchical Resource Identifiers (HRI's)

We use sequential ExtIds compute the final ChainID, for example a movie, organized by year:

```
Chain ID = Chain(
	ExtId[0]="movies",
	ExtId[1]="2018",
	ExtId[2]="Thor Ragnarok"
)
```

This creates a "directory" structure that can be used to navigate and access resources on the Factom blockchain.



## Standardized HRI's For Common Resources
