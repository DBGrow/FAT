# Summary

This document describes the functionality, datastructures, validation rules of
the **FAT-0** token standard: A fungible data only token standard built on
Factom chains and entries. It's functionality is most alike the ERC-20 token
standard of Ethereum.


# Motivation

Create a decentralized, open token standard on top of the Factom protocol. The
FAT-0 standard allows issuance and trade tokenized assets between Factoid
addresses.

Following the Factom ethos, FAT standards are data-only protocols, and can be
implemented on any system that supports immutable ordered data.

FAT-0 fills a critical gap between Colored Coins (BTC) and ERC (Ethereum)
tokens. Implementation of the FAT-0 standard on Factom results in an immutable,
fixed cost token system that is inexpensive to build, issue, and transfer
tokens on:

- $0.02 USD to issue a new FAT-0 token
  - Additional $0.001 USD/KB of optional user defined content up to 10KB
- $0.002 USD to transact an unlimited number of tokens
  - Additional $0.001 USD/KB of optional user defined content up to 10KB

Because the standard supports arbitrary user defined data, it offers a base for
more complex user defined behavior based on the underlying data. Custom token
systems may be built on top of the basic functionality of this standard.

Applications include ICOs, digital currencies, digital goods, and accounting.


# Specification

## Token ID

A human readable string unique to the Issuer's Identity Chain ID. This ID and
the Issuer's Identity Chain ID are the only pieces of data needed to retrieve
the token's data from Factom. It should be something short and memorable
related to your token. For example: `mytoken` is the token ID of the FAT-0 test
token: My Token (MYT).

TODO: Add example issuer id for this example token.

Note that two Issuers could use the same Token ID since the Issuers will have
different Identity Chain IDs. It is up to users to decide which Issuer's token
they wish to use. Trust in an Issuer is necessary to trust the integrity of
future token distribution decisions.


## Addresses

FAT-0 uses Factom's [Factoid
Address](https://github.com/FactomProject/FactomDocs/blob/master/factomDataStructureDetails.md#human-readable-addresses)
key pairs based on ed25519 cryptography to send and receive tokens.


### Reserved Coinbase & Burn Address

The 0th Factoid Address: `FA1y5ZGuHSLmf2TqNf6hVMkPiNGyQpQDTFJvDLRkKQaoPo4bmbgu`
representing a private key with all zeros is a reserved address for minting and
burning tokens.

Only coinbase transactions are allowed from this address, which must be signed
by the identity of the token issuer. Tokens sent to this address are provably
un-spendable (burnt). This address is not allowed to send tokens from its
balance under any circumstance.


## Token Issuance Chain

A Factom chain is used to hold data about the token's issuance.


### Issuance Chain ID `extends` [FATIP-100](100.md)

The Issuance Chain ID can be calculated by using the Issuer's Identity Chain ID
and the Token ID. The Issuance Chain has the following External IDs.

| External ID Index | External ID Value                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 0                 | "token"                                      |
| 1                 | \<Hex Encoded Token ID>                      |
| 2                 | "issuer"                                     |
| 3                 | \<Hex Encoded Issuer Identity Root Chain ID> |

For example, for FAT-0 token `mytoken`:

```
Chain ID = sha256(sha256("token") | sha256("mytoken") | sha256("issuer") | sha256("888888dd9e60c1f0216f753caf5c9b5be4c9ca69db27a6c33d30dce3fe5ee709"))
Chain ID = 0x85ab32f9748bf4c24cedb301bc5a4938eb5cd4a5b0bb46b70027bf983f579a2e
```


### Token Issuance Entry `extends` [FATIP-101](101.md)

A data structure called the Token Issuance holds the information about the
FAT-0 token such as it's name, symbol, supply, and ID.

The official issuance entry is the first well-formed entry on the token's
issuance chain that has a valid signature from the Issuer's SK1 key identified
by the Issuer's Identity Chain. There may only be one issuance entry per FAT-0
token. The issuance entry does not have to be the first entry in the chain.
Invalid entries are simply ignored.

Issuance entries are only valid if the Identity Chain ID matches the Identity
Chain ID used in the Chain's second External ID (`ExtID[1]`).


#### Issuance Entry Content Example

```json
{
  "type": "FAT-0",
  "issuer": "888888dd9e60c1f0216f753caf5c9b5be4c9ca69db27a6c33d30dce3fe5ee709",

}
```

Where sha256d is a double round of sha256 hashing: `sha256d(x) =
sha256(sha256(x))`


## Token Transaction Chain

A Factom chain is used to hold the initial distributions and transactions of
the token. The Factom Blockchain provides a fixed ordering of transactions, a
requirement for determining consensus around the state of balances and
transaction validation. Anyone who wishes to make a transaction must create a
well-formed entry with a valid signature on token's transactions chain.


### Transaction Chain ID `extends` [FATIP-100](100.md)

The Transaction Chain ID can be calculated by using the Issuer's Identity Chain
ID and the Token ID. The Issuance Chain has the following External IDs.

| External ID Index | External ID Value                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 0                 | "token"                                      |
| 1                 | \<Hex Encoded Token ID>                      |
| 2                 | "issuer"                                     |
| 3                 | \<Hex Encoded Issuer Identity Root Chain ID> |
| 4                 | "transactions"                               |

For example, for FAT-0 token `mytoken`:

```
Chain ID = sha256(sha256("token") | sha256("mytoken") | sha256("issuer") | sha256("888888dd9e60c1f0216f753caf5c9b5be4c9ca69db27a6c33d30dce3fe5ee709") | sha256("transactions"))
Chain ID = 0x85ab32f9748bf4c24cedb301bc5a4938eb5cd4a5b0bb46b70027bf983f579a2e
```


### Token Transaction Entry `extends` [FATIP-101](101.md)

Token Transaction Entries represent the signed transfer of an amount of FAT-0
tokens from one Factoid address to another.

Transaction entries are the content of the entries on the token's transaction
chain. The order of transaction entries represents a time ordered, locked
record of submission for each transaction in Factom from oldest to newest.

FAT-0 Transactions borrow cryptographic elements from Factoid Transaction,
including it's RCD (Redeem Condition Datastructure), and signatures. Each FAT-0
Transaction represents a single input single output transaction (Single RCD)
instead of the multi-RCD structure of existing Factoid transactions.


#### Transaction Entry Content Example

```json
{
  "input": {
    "address": "FA1zT4aFpEvcnPqPCigB3fvGu4Q4mTXY22iiuV69DqE1pNhdF2MC",

**\* = required for coinbase transaction**



#### Contextual Tansaction Validation

Tansactions must be validated in context of their order within the transaction
history to applied to an address's balance. Transactions must meet all of the
following criteria to be valid:

- Must meet and pass all applicable validation criteria specified in the above
  table
- `signature` may not be reused for any transaction
- **IF**: The transaction is a coinbase transaction (From
  `FA1y5ZGuHSLmf2TqNf6hVMkPiNGyQpQDTFJvDLRkKQaoPo4bmbgu`):
  - `idSignature` may not be reused for any issuance (`issuance.signature`) or
    coinbase transaction
  - Issuing `input.amount` must not push the circulating supply of the token
    over it's maximum (`issuance.supply`). If the supply is unlimited, this is
ignored.

- **ELSE IF**: The transaction is a normal transaction:
  - The current balance of `input.address` must be sufficient to cover
    `input.amount`


Assuming these criteria are met,  `input.amount` is deducted from
`input.address` and credited to `output.address`. In the case of a coinbase
transaction, the deduction does not occur for `input.address`.

This filtering and balance application process is repeated for all transactions
in chronological order to reach the current state of the token.


# Implementation

Overall the FAT-0 standard on Factom lends itself to being cross platform. Any
client capable of executing HTTP requests to a local or remote Factom full node
should be able to implement the standard.

Due to the specific storage and validation aspects of the standard and Factom's
functionality, there are some implementation guidelines recommended.


## Key-Value Storage

For efficiency it is required to store large quantities of key:value data
representing mappings of:

- Transaction entry hashes **=>** transaction objects
- Transaction indexes(natural order) **=>** transaction entry hashes
- Factoid address **=>** token balances

A high performance external key value store like Redis would be ideal for such
purposes. If an external database is not available then a local LevelDB or
Sqlite database would suffice. It's important to defer storage to the disk
instead of memory, as a successful token will have an ever increasing ordered
list of transactions.


## Filtering

It's required to check for and detect duplicate signatures for FAT-0
transactions and issuances. Iteration and search over the entire array of
transactions is infeasible due to scaling requirements. Probabilistic
datastructures such as Bloom Filters offer a space efficient and scalable
solution to this issue with a tunable false-positive rate.

### Bloom Filter Implementation

Bloom filters take in parameters to tune their size and false-positive rate.

- **n** - The number of items in the filter
- **p** - The target false positive rate
- **k** - The number of hash functions to act as buckets

Applying these parameters to an estimation function results in **m**, the total
size of the filter in bits.


For the purposes of FAT-0, the following parameters are recommended:

- **p** - 1 / 1,000,000,000 (1.0E-9)
- **k** - 29.89

At a **n** of 1M signatures this results in a **m** of ~5.2 MB, which is
acceptable when we compare it with the overhead of the alternative. At an **n**
of 1,000,000 the equivalent array/map datastructure would consume ~128 MB not
including iteration overhead which does not scale linearly. Here is a
visualization of how the proposed bloom filter implementation scales:

![Bloom Filter Implementation](/home/devon/Desktop/Screenshot from 2018-08-14 13-23-48.png)

As the number of transactions increases infinitely, it is possible to readjust
the parameters of the filter to reach an acceptable false positive rate. This
however requires a rebuild of the filter from the transaction database, and
also opens up the possibility of forking. To put the scale required for this
redefinition in perspective, Bitcoin currently has around 333M confirmed
transactions compared to our theoretical **n** of 1M.

With good will and proper salting it's virtually impossible to produce a
duplicate signature. However, malicious actors must be prevented from executing
copy paste replay attacks that can drain accounts within the implementation. As
the filter grows in accuracy towards 100%, the result approaches "ultimate
truth" of the system's state.


## API Stack

A layered API approach is necessary for the protocol to be both truthful and
scalable.

<br/>
<br/>

![](https://github.com/DBGrow/FAT/blob/master/assets/APISTACK.png)

<br/>
<br/>

The Factom blockchain holds all of the data for the Factom based FAT-0 tokens.
Entries are locked into Factom Chains representing the transaction and issuance
information for each token. Every 10 Minutes Factom is hashed into the Bitcoin
blockchain to secure it forever.


### Medium Node

Medium nodes maintain a copy of the complete transaction databases of tokens on
a token by token basis. Because of the scale involved, an external operational
database is required to store all the entries. This is the highest level of
truth in the protocol at the expense of size.

Full nodes can run API's to allow other clients lower in the hierarchy access
filtered and parsed token data.


### Light Node

Light nodes maintain a running copy of the complete transaction databases of
tokens on a token by token basis, backed by a full node. Light nodes can run
API's to allow other clients lower in the hierarchy access filtered and parsed
token data. Light nodes can also access the Factom network directly if
necessary.


### Client

Clients can use either a medium or light node to access data about FAT-0
tokens. This is usually embedded in a webpage, or mobile device, or other
application that needs to be light weight.


## Private or Encrypted Tokens

Private tokens are useful for conducting private development and testing,
internal usage tokens, and creating permissioned token systems. Issuance and
Transaction content can be encrypted using symmetric or asymmetric encryption
to restrict access and operation to key holders.


## Compression

Issuance and Transaction content can be compressed to save on the cost of Entry
Credits and reduce bloat on the Factom blockchain. In many cases transaction
entries are pushed over the boundary from 1EC (<=1KB) to 2EC (>1KB <= 2KB) in
cost due to a couple hundred extra bytes. Using an effective compression
algorithm that balances size savings and speed addresses this and can reduce
the EC cost of transactions by half.
