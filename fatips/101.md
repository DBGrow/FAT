# Summary

This standard defines the use of Factom based digital identities in the FAT
ecosystem. Factom Identity Chains allow a mechanism for secure key rotation
while maintaining the continuity of an established Identity.


# Motivation

Factom is a permissionless blockchain, meaning that anyone may submit an entry
to any chain. For FAT chains, clients require a mechanism for determining
whether or not an entry was submitted by an authorized entity, such as the
Issuer. Factom Identity Chains may have many keys associated with them, and so
a standard is required to establish which key should be considered valid for
any particular blockheight.


# Specification

Currently FAT supports the current standard for [Factom Digital
Identities](https://github.com/FactomProject/FactomDocs/blob/master/Identity.md),
which are designed for and implemented in the Factom Authority Set to link
ANO's real world identities to their servers.

To summarize the features of the implemented Factom identity solution:

- An authority party privately generates a digital identity on a secure
  computer, creating a set of ed25519 key pairs.
- The public parts of the Identity are registered by the authority party on a
  Factom chain to attest to its existence.
- The authority party "claims" the digital identity by publicly linking to it.
  Verification of ownership can be obtained by signing of arbitrary, unique
data using the identity's private keys.

## ID Key

Identity Chains establish a hierarchy of keys, numbered 1 through 4. The
private keys are called `sk1`-`sk4` and the public keys are called `id1`-`id4`
because these are the prefixes used in the [human readable
representations](https://github.com/FactomProject/FactomDocs/blob/master/Identity.md#human-readable-identity-keys).

Keys with higher numbers are intended to be able to sign key rotations of lower
numbered keys. FAT chains requiring a signature from an Identity must use the
lowest numbered key (`sk1`/`id1`) key currently established at the blockheight
of the entry in question.


### RCD

Identity Keys use the same [RCD scheme that Factoid addresses
use](https://github.com/FactomProject/FactomDocs/blob/master/Identity.md#factom-identity-chain-creation).
This means that the `id1` "key" is actually the RCD Hash (type `0x01`) of the
actual public key data. Thus, the RCD itself must also be provided with the
signature containing the actual public key data. A signature is verified
against the public key provided in the RCD, and then the RCD hash must equal
the data payload of the ID key.



# Implementation

Currently Factom has not actually implemented a standard for rotating lower
level keys. This means that entities must treat all of their keys very securely
until key rotation is specified and implemented.

However, key rotation for the currently used Identity Chain standard may never
be implemented because a new improved Identity Chain standard has been created,
but not published or finalized. In the future this spec will allow for use of
either Identity Chain standard.
