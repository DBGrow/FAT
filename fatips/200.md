[TOC]

# Summary

Provide a standard mechanism to define activation periods for assets and datastructures, based on [Unix Epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) timestamps.

# Motivation

Many real world systems implement expiration dates as part of their core functionality. For example rewards points, guest passes, coupons, vouchers, and uncountable other systems. As of the time of publishing FAT specifications do not account for this functionality.

# Specification

The beginning and end timestamps for activation shall be denoted as fields in JSON, in an entry's content. A Unix epoch integer is used to denote timestamps (The number of seconds elapsed since January 1st, 1970). "Time of publishing" refers to the Unix epoch at which the data was committed to Factom.

```json
{
    "activation": 1538086959,
    "expiration": 1539000000
}
```

| Name         | Type   | Description                                                  | Validation                                                   | Required |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| `activation` | number | Unix epoch at which to begin the activation period, inclusive. | Positive nonzero integer. If omitted, or the Unix epoch at time of publishing is greater than or equal to `activation`, the activation is immediate. | **N***   |
| `expiration` | number | Unix epoch at which to end the activation period, inclusive. | Positive nonzero integer. Must be greater than than the Unix epoch at time of publishing, and `activation` if specified. If omitted, the activation period is indefinite. | **N***   |

***** = At least one is required
