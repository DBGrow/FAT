# Summary

This document describes the functionality, data structures, and validation
rules of the **FAT-0** token standard. FAT-0 is a fungible token standard. Its
functionality is most alike to the ERC-20 token standard of Ethereum.


# Motivation

Fungible tokens are ubiquitous in the cryptocurrency space. The properties of
fungible tokens are generally what most people expect from a currency: units of
the token are interchangeable and indistinguishable. Most currencies and assets
have this property, thus it follows that the first basic FAT token type should
be a simple fungible token.


# Specification

## Token Chain

A single Factom chain is used to hold the initialization of the token and all
subsequent transaction. The Factom Blockchain provides the underlying consensus
mechanism for the content and ordering of transactions. Clients shall apply
transactions in the order that they appear in the Factom Token Chain.

### Token Chain ID `inherits` [FATIP-100](100.md)

The Token Chain ID is calculated by using the Token ID and the Issuer's
Identity Chain ID as described in [FATIP-100](100.md).

As the purpose of the first entry in the Token Chain is solely intended to
create a chain with the appropriate Name IDs, the content of the first entry in
a Token Chain is ignored.

## Token Chain Entries

Factom Chains are permissionless, meaning that anyone can pay to submit any
entry on any chain. Thus implementations must parse all entries and determine
their validity. There are two main types of valid Token entries: Initialization
and Transactions.


### Global Requirements

All valid entries must adhere to the following.

#### Valid Factom Entry On Token Chain

Only entries submitted to the Token Chain may be valid. Thus Entries must be
valid according to Factom.

#### Strict JSON Parsing

In order to ensure consistency across implementations, all JSON must be parsed
very strictly. In addition to the JSON structure being well-formed and all
required fields present, unknown fields are strictly prohibited and fields with
unexpected types are strictly prohibited. Finally, duplicate fields are
strictly prohibited despite technically being valid JSON.

#### External IDs and Signatures `inherits` [FATIP-103](103.md)

All valid entries must have External IDs with valid signatures that conform to
the specifications defined by [FATIP-103](103.md). The required set of
signatures depends on the entry and is defined below for each entry type.

### Token Initialization Entry

The Token Initialization Entry establishes parameters and metadata about the
Token. All entries prior to the first valid Initialization Entry shall be
ignored. A Token may only be initialized once and these parameters and metadata
cannot ever be modified.

### Issuance Entry Content Example

```json
{
  "type": "FAT-0",
  "supply": 10000000,
  "symbol": "EXT",
  "metadata": {"custom-field": "example"}
}
```

### Issuance Entry Field Summary & Validation

| Name   | Type   | Description                                                  | Validation                                                   | Required |
| ------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| type   | string | The type of this token issuance                              | Must equal 'FAT-0'                                           | Y        |
| supply | number | The maximum possible number of tokens that can be in circulation | Must be greater than 0 if included. Omission means supply is unlimited | N        |
| symbol | string | The display symbol of the token                              | must be A-Z, and 1-4 characters in length                    | N        |
| metadata | any | Optional metadata defined by the Issuer                       |                                                              | N        |


## Addresses

FAT-0 uses Factom's [Factoid
Address](https://github.com/FactomProject/FactomDocs/blob/master/factomDataStructureDetails.md#human-readable-addresses)
RCD key pairs based on ed25519 cryptography to send and receive tokens.

### Reserved Coinbase & Burn Address

The public Factoid Address
`FA1zT4aFpEvcnPqPCigB3fvGu4Q4mTXY22iiuV69DqE1pNhdF2MC`, corresponding to the
Factoid private key with all zeros
(`Fs1KWJrpLdfucvmYwN2nWrwepLn8ercpMbzXshd1g8zyhKXLVLWj`) is a reserved address
for two purposes: minting and burning tokens.

Any tokens sent *to* the Coinbase address are forever burned and irrecoverable,
even by the Issuer of the token.

Only valid Coinbase Transactions signed by the Issuer may use the Coinbase
address and an *input*. Coinbase Transactions effectively issue and distribute
new tokens to other addresses. To clarify, tokens sent from this address are
*not* previously burned tokens, but new tokens adding to the circulating
supply. Coinbase Transactions that increase the total supply (circulating and
burned) beyond the maximum supply declared in the Initialization Entry of the
token are always invalid.




### Token Transaction Entry `extends` [FATIP-101](101.md)

Token Transaction Entries represent the signed transfer of an amount of FAT-0
tokens from one Factoid address to another. Anyone who wishes to make a
transaction must create a well-formed entry with a valid signature on the
token's chain.

The order of transactions is solely determined by the order the transaction
entries appear in the token chain. Factom provides a locked, time ordered
record of submission for each transaction. The presense of a Transaction Entry
in the chain is necessary but not sufficient for the transaction to be
considered valid. Sufficient balance, valid signatures, as well as some other
requirements to prevent replay attacks are described below.

FAT-0 transactions borrow cryptographic elements from Factoid Transactions,
including it's RCD (Redeem Condition Datastructure) address format, and
signatures. FAT-0 transactions are multi-input, multi-output (MIMO).

For standard transactions, RCDs and corresponding signatures are provided in
the External IDs of the Transaction Entry. For coinbase transactions that
initially distribute tokens, the signatures are provided in the structure of
the entry as described by FATIP-101.

#### Transaction ID

The unique ID of a transaction is its entry hash in the Factom blockchain. This
is a unique hash of all of the data in the content and the External IDs of the
entry.


#### Transaction Entry Content Example

```json
{
   "inputs:":{
      "FA1zT4aFpEvcnPqPCigB3fvGu4Q4mTXY22iiuV69DqE1pNhdF2MC": 100,
      "FA2y6VYYPR9Y9Vyy1ZuZqWWRXGXLeuvsLWGkDxq3Ed7yc11dbBKV": 50
   },
   "outputs:":{
      "FA3aECpw3gEZ7CMQvRNxEtKBGKAos3922oqYLcHQ9NqXHudC6YBM": 150
   },
   "salt":"80d87a8bd5cf2a3eca9037c2229f3701eed29360caa975531ef5fe476b1b70b5"
}
```


#### Transaction Entry JSON Field Summary & Validation

| Name      | Type   | Description                           | Validation                                                   | Required |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| `inputs`  | object | The inputs of this this transaction   | Mapping of Public Factoid Address => Input amount. Amount must be a positive nonzero integer (units of of 1^-10 of a token). Must contain at least 1 key-value pair. No duplicate keys. | Y        |
| `outputs` | object | The outputs of this transaction       | Mapping of Public Factoid Address => Input amount. Amount must be a positive nonzero integer (units of of 1^-10 of a token). Must contain at least 1 key-value pair. No duplicate keys. | Y        |
| `salt`    | string | Random string to salt the transaction |                                             | N        |


#### External IDs
Transaction Entries must include exactly two External IDs for every input
address listed in the transaction: the RCD that hashes to the corresponding
input address, and a signature.

In the case of normal transaction, all inputs must have a corresponding RCD in
an even External ID.

In the case of coinbase transactions, the RCD in the 0th External ID must hash
to the ID Key of the issuing Identity as per [FATIP-101](101.md).

Since the Transaction Entry Hash MUST be unique, implementations must ignore
any entries that do not contain EXACTLY twice as many External IDs as inputs.
This prevents replay of transactions through manipulating the Transaction Entry
Hash by appending additional External IDs to a previously posted valid
transaction.

In the following table `X` is any even number less than `2n`.

| External ID Index          | External ID Value (RAW DATA)                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0                          | RCD corresponding to one of the inputs or Issuer ID Key      |
| 1                          | ed25519 signature by key of RCD in preceding External ID     |
| 2                          | RCD corresponding to one of the inputs                       |
| 3                          | ed25519 signature by key of RCD in preceding External ID     |
| ...                        |                                                              |
| `X`                        | RCD corresponding to one of the inputs                       |
| `X + 1`                    | ed25519 signature by key of RCD in preceding External ID     |


##### Encoding

All of the RCD and Signature External IDs in a Transaction Entry shall be raw
data and not use any encoding. The [Factom
Explorer](https://explorer.factom.com/) now properly displays External IDs that
contain raw data as hex encoded data. So there is little reason to encode the
data we put in the External IDs.


##### RCD

The RCD is a data structure that hashes to the payload of a Factoid Address.
The RCD data structure is 33 bytes long. The first byte is the RCD type
(`0x01`), the remaining 32 bytes are a ed25519 public key.

Factoid Addresses contain a header and a checksum, which is described futher in
the [Factom Data Structures
Documentation](https://github.com/FactomProject/FactomDocs/blob/master/factomDataStructureDetails.md#human-readable-addresses).

To validate that an RCD "corresponds" to a Factoid Address,
1. Convert the Factoid Address string from base58 to raw bytes.
2. Remove the first 2 bytes header bytes and the last four bytes checksum
   bytes.
3. The remaining 32 bytes must be the double SHA256 hash of the raw bytes of
   the RCD.


##### Signature

The cryptographic signature algorithm is the same as that used in a [Factoid
Transaction](https://github.com/FactomProject/FactomDocs/blob/master/factomDataStructureDetails.md#factoid-transaction).

From the Factom Documentation:
> - Factoids use Ed25519 with Schnorr signatures.  They have [many
>   benefits](https://ripple.com/uncategorized/curves-with-a-twist/0) over the
>   ECDSA signatures used in Bitcoin.
> - The signatures are enforced to be
>   [canonical](https://github.com/FactomProject/ed25519/blob/master/ed25519.go#L143).
>   This will limit malleability by attackers without the private key.

A signed transaction should only be valid once, so signed data must be
protected against replay within a given FAT chain and across various FAT
chains. For this reason both the index of the External ID and the chain id is
used to salt the signature. This prevents reordering the External IDs and
replaying a transaction on a different chain.

Let `i` be the integer index of the External ID that the signature will be
place in the Factom Entry.

The signed data shall be the concatenation of the following:
1. The shortest (no leading zeros) string decimal representation of `int(i/2)`
2. The raw bytes of the chain ID
3. The content of the entry

For example, if there were two inputs, and `+` is concatenation of bytes, then
the valid External IDs would be,
```
ExtID[0] = 0x01 + pub_key0
ExtID[1] = ed25519_sign(priv_key0, "0" + chain_id + entry_content)
ExtID[2] = 0x01 + pub_key1
ExtID[3] = ed25519_sign(priv_key1, "1" + chain_id + entry_content)
```

### Transaction Validation and State

There are two types of transactions which have slightly different validation
requirements: Normal transactions between Factoid Addresses, and Coinbase
transactions that mint tokens. Coinbase transactions require an additional
signature of the entry content by the issuer, stored in the transaction's
ExtIds.

A Coinbase transaction is identified by whether it has an input from the
Coinbase address: `FA1zT4aFpEvcnPqPCigB3fvGu4Q4mTXY22iiuV69DqE1pNhdF2MC`

#### Computing the current state

Implementations must maintain the state of the balances of all addresses in
order to evaluate the validity of a transaction. The current state can be built
by iterating through all entries in the token chain and sequentially, updating
the state for any transaction that meets all of the necessary Transaction
Validation Requirements.

The following pseudo code describes how to compute the current state of all
balances. A transaction must be applied entirely or not at all. Entries that
are not valid transactions are simply ignored. Transactions must be evaluated
in the order that they appear in the token chain.

```
for entry in transaction_chain.entries:
    if entry.is_valid_transaction():
        if !entry.is_coinbase_transaction():
            for input in entry.inputs:
                balances[input.address] -= input.amount
        for output in entry.outputs:
            balances[output.address] += output.amount
```


#### Transaction Validation Requirements

All Transactions must meet all of the T.x requirements.

Normal Transactions must additionally meet all of the N.x requirements.

Coinbase Transactions must additionally meet all of the C.x requirements.

In general, requirements are ordered by the computational and programmatic ease
of checking.

The x.1.x requirements are generally data structure validations.

The x.2.x requirements are generally parsing and other content validations.

The x.3.x requirements are generally related to cryptographic validations.

##### T.x Requirements for all transactions

- T.1.1: The content of the entry must be a single well-formed JSON.
- T.1.2: The JSON must contain all required transaction fields listed in the
  above table. The fields must comply with all stated validation criteria. No
unspecified fields may be present.
- T.1.3: The entry MUST contain exactly `2n` External IDs, where `n` is the
  number of keys in the `inputs` object. This is required to prevent replay
attacks.
- T.1.4: A Factoid Address may only appear ONCE in the `inputs` and `outputs`
  objects combined. This means that the "inputs" and "outputs" may not share
any common keys (Factoid Addresses), nor each have any duplicates.
- T.2.1: The sum of all values(amounts) in the `inputs` object must be equal to
  the sum of all values(amounts) in the `outputs` object.
- T.2.2: The entry hash of the transaction entry must be unique among all
  transactions belonging to this token.
- T.3.1: If `i` is odd then the `i`th External ID must be the raw data of a
  valid signature verified against the public key stored in the last 32 bytes
of the RCD in the `i-1`th External ID. The signed message shall be the
following three things concatenated in order:
    1. The shortest (no leading "0") decimal string representation of int(i/2)
    2. The raw bytes of the chain id
    3. The raw bytes of the content of the entry

The first prevents replay attacks from reordering External IDs, and the second
prevents replay attacks across FAT token chains.

##### N.x Requirements for normal account-to-account transactions

Normal transactions must meet all T.x and N.x requirements.

All references to External ID indexes use `0`-based indexing.

- N.2.1: The Coinbase address
  (`FA1zT4aFpEvcnPqPCigB3fvGu4Q4mTXY22iiuV69DqE1pNhdF2MC`) may not exist as a
key in `inputs`.
- N.2.2: The Factoid Addresses (keys) in `inputs` must all have balances
  greater than or equal to their respective input amounts.
- N.3.1: For each input address, there exists an External ID with even index
  which is the raw data of an RCD which hashes to the raw data payload of the
human readable Factoid Address input.

##### C.x Requirements for Coinbase distribution transactions

Coinbase transactions must meet all T.x and C.x requirements.

- C.1.1: The `inputs` object may contain only the public coinbase address as a
  key (`FA1zT4aFpEvcnPqPCigB3fvGu4Q4mTXY22iiuV69DqE1pNhdF2MC`)
- C.2.1: The coinbase input amount plus the sum of tokens issued in all
  previous Coinbase transactions must be less than or equal to `supply` from
the Issuance entry (if not unlimited).
- C.3.1: The RCD in the first External ID must hash to the PK1 key of the Token
  Issuer's Identity Chain.
