# Summary

This standard defines how FAT token's Factom Chain ID's and other resources are
derived based on a unique identifier. This standard also defines a basic
hierarchical naming convention used to designate hierarchical resources on the
Factom blockchain using the same derivation method.


# Motivation

A standard convention for storing and locating resources on the Factom
blockchain is imperative.


# Specification

The standard uses Factom Chain's ExtIDs to deterministically generate a token's
root chain ID's based on a unique input: The token ID. The token's root chain
is also called the Issuance chain, which holds required information about the
token.

The token's root chain is equivalent to starting a chain fresh Factom chain
with ExtId[0] = token ID

We use sequential sha256 hashes (sha256d) to compute the final ChainID as per
Factom's Chain Spec:

```
Chain ID = sha256(sha256(<Token ID>))
```

For example, for FAT token `mytoken`:

```
Chain ID = sha256(sha256("mytoken"))
Chain ID = efeb6db82bf222a87c1fc756e09197ed6ac7672641761a019c26530967f27744
```


## Hierarchical Resources Identifiers

A colon delimited URI scheme is devised for FAT Tokens:

```
Chain ID = sha256(sha256(<Token ID>+":transactions"))
```

The resulting chain ID is the chain responsible for tracking the transactions
of token \<Token ID>

For example, the transaction chain of mytoken:

```
Chain ID = sha256(sha256("mytoken:transactions"))
Chain ID = efeb6db82bf222a87c1fc756e09197ed6ac7672641761a019c26530967f27744
```
