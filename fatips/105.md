| 105   | Host Interface Standard | WIP    | Core     | Devon Katz\<<devonk@dbgrow.com>\> | 9-17-2019 |



# Summary

This standard describes the basic host interface that a WASM based contract has access to as a FAT token contract. The interface is used to allow contracts access to critical context information from the host environment, which would ordinarily be completely restricted. This specification includes a basic mechanism for storing data persistently across contract calls, allowing stateful behavior for FAT contracts.

# Motivation

FAT smart contracts have the ability to securely execute trustless logic; However, with this security comes seclusion and isolation. Contracts may need access to more context info than a single contract call's `func` and `args` can contain to do their job. 

For example:

- What is the calling transaction's entryhash?
- How many tokens were sent in the transaction?
- Who sent the transaction?
- What is the current balance at the contract?
- What is the current timestamp or block height?
- What value was placed in addressable persistent storage from the last call?

For even basic contract applications, this vital information is required. This standard seeks to define a standard namespace and set of functions & constants WASM contracs can use to conduct their operations



# Specification

To access the host's functions, they must be declared as external functions in the WASM code. For example, in C, this is how the contract would declare the function to return the current blockheight from the host:

```c
extern int getHeight(void);
```

The functions mentioned in this document are defined identically with a root namespace, albeit given different argument and return types.

Since the interface is only is used by the host, functions may be omitted if not required by the contract.
