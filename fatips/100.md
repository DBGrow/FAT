[TOC]

# Summary

This standard defines how FAT token's Factom Chain ID's and other resources are
derived based on a unique identifier. This standard also defines a basic
hierarchical naming convention used to designate hierarchical resources on the
Factom blockchain using the same derivation method.


# Motivation

A standard convention for storing and locating resources on the Factom
blockchain is imperative for interoperability. ChainIDs are used to look up
specific chains in the Factom Blockchain and are deterministically derived from
an ordered set of External IDs, also called Chain Name segments.


# Specification

This standard uses Factom Chain's External IDs to deterministically generate a
resource's chain IDs based on a unique set of hierarchical inputs.

## Chain ID derivation

From the [Factom
Documentation](https://github.com/FactomProject/FactomDocs/blob/master/factomDataStructureDetails.md#chainid):

>A ChainID is a series of SHA256 hashes of Chain Name segments. The ChainID is
>32 bytes long. The ChainID must be the hash of something to only have opaque
>data in the higher level block structures.
>
>The algorithm hashes each segment of the Chain Name. Those hashes are
>concatenated, and are hashed again into a single 32 byte value.
>
>Getting a ChainID from a single segment Chain Name would be equivalent of
>hashing the Chain Name twice.
>
>```
>ChainID = SHA256( SHA256(Name[0]) | SHA256(Name[1]) | ... | SHA256(Name[X]) )
>```

The standard human readable form of a Chain IDs is hex encoded.

In the Factom Documentation, the External IDs of the first entry in a chain are
called the Chain's Name Segments. We use the term External ID in this document
to refer to a chain's Name Segments. Name Segments are just a special term for
the External IDs of the first entry in a chain.


## Hierarchical Resource Identifiers (HRI's)

We can use sequential External IDs to indicate increased specificity about the
data a chain holds. For example a chain with data about a movie might use the
following External IDs.

```
ExtId[0]="movies",
ExtId[1]="2018",
ExtId[2]="Thor Ragnarok"
```

This creates a directory-like structure that can be used to navigate and access
resources on the Factom blockchain.


## Standardized HRI's For Common FAT Resource Chains

Quoted strings indicate that the quoted text is used (without quotes) as the
External ID.

Angle brackets indicate that the appropriate value described should be used as
the External ID.

A single dash indicates that the External ID is not used. Using an empty
External ID is possible but it is incorrect and will result in the wrong Chain
ID.

| Chain Description                          | ExtID[0] | ExtID[1]                                     | ExtID[2]    | ExtID[3]       |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Token Issuance Chain ([FATIP-0](0.MD))     | "token"  | \<Hex Encoded Issuer Identity Root Chain ID> | \<Token ID> | -              |
| Token Transaction Chain  ([FATIP-0](0.MD)) | "token"  | \<Hex Encoded Issuer Identity Root Chain ID> | \<Token ID> | "transactions" |
| FAT Index Chain ([FATIP-102](102.MD))      | "index"  | "FAT"                                        | -           | -              |
|                                            |          |                                              |             |                |
