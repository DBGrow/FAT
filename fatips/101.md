# Summary

This document describes the standardized implementation of Factom based digital identities in the FAT ecosystem. Identities are needed for signing and authentication of data.



# Motivation

As a data-only protocol, FAT necessitates signing authorities to issue tokens, perform coinbase transactions, and many other operations. Digital identities are a means to authenticate that a creation, or balance altering event is valid, and originated from a trusted source.



# Specification

This standard utilizes [Factom Digital Identities](https://github.com/FactomProject/FactomDocs/blob/master/Identity.md), which are implemented in the Factom Authority Set to link ANO's real world identities to their servers.

To summarize the features of the implemented Factom identity solution:

- An authority party privately generates a digital identity on a secure computer, creating a number of ed25519 key pairs.
- The public parts of the Identity are registered by the authority party on Factom to attest to it's existence.
- The authority party "claims" the digital identity by publicly linking to it. Verification of ownership can be obtained by signing of arbitrary, unique data using the identity's private keys.





## Cryptographic Material

For each piece of data that needs to be signed authenticated by a digital identity (i.e. issuance, coinbase transaction, new tokens), standardized field names are used for each required piece of cryptographic material the signing process.



### IDKey

The IDKey is the preimage of the signing identity's identity key. It is used to verify signatures of the signing identity. The IDKey can be found as the 4th ExtID in the Identity's registration entry. The registration entry is expected to be the second entry in the identity's root chain.

The IDKey is implicit based on the context, and is not necessarily explicitly included in datastructures.  It is left up to inheriting specs to define how to denote the signing identity's root chain ID.

For example, in FAT-0 and other standards the `issuer` field in the token issuance entry is the root chain ID of the issuing identity.



### Nonce

The nonce is the data to sign. It should be unique so as to produce a unique signature.

The nonce is always stored under the field name `idNonce`.



### Signature 

The signature is the output of the ed25519 signature function. It's inputs are the Identity's first ed25519 private key (SK1), and the Nonce. It's output is the signature of the digital identity. It can be verified using the publicly available IDKey, Signature, and Nonce.

The nonce is always stored under the field name `idSignature`.



### Example

```
{
	"idNonce": "7d6920cecc97a105a93763800c692afaf40a87d42c4f505b4a226c0f0e5a7a43",
	"idSignature": "8122b4c0a26e82100ff2583c3d200e9a731b9d5a7ca8674e57589b353348a5df89625e64a23758b71e83ba89ff6fb0e6b7913924554141a25523d8180f022802"
}
```
