# Summary

This document describes the functionality, datastructures, and validation rules
of the **FAT-0** token standard. FAT-0 is a data-only, fungible token standard
built on Factom chains and entries. Its functionality is most alike to the
ERC-20 token standard of Ethereum.


# Motivation

Create a decentralized, open token standard on top of the Factom protocol. The
FAT-0 standard allows issuance and trade tokenized assets between Factoid
addresses.

Following the Factom ethos, FAT standards are data-only protocols, and can be
implemented on top of any system that supports immutable ordered data, such as
Factom.

FAT-0 fills a critical gap between Colored Coins (BTC) and ERC (Ethereum)
tokens. Implementation of the FAT-0 standard on Factom results in an immutable,
fixed cost token system that is inexpensive to build, issue, and transfer
tokens on:

- $0.02 USD to issue a new FAT-0 token
  - Additional $0.001 USD/KB of optional user defined content up to 10KB
- $0.002 USD to transact an unlimited number of tokens
  - Additional $0.001 USD/KB of optional user defined content up to 10KB

Because the standard supports arbitrary user defined data, it offers a base for
more complex user defined behavior based on the underlying data. Custom token
systems may be built on top of the basic functionality of this standard.

Applications include ICOs, digital currencies, digital goods, and accounting.


# Specification

## Token ID

A human readable string unique to the Issuer's Identity Chain ID. This ID and
the Issuer's Identity Chain ID are the only pieces of data needed to retrieve
the token's data from Factom. It should be something short and memorable
related to your token. For example: `mytoken` is the token ID of the FAT-0 test
token: My Token (MYT).

TODO: Add example issuer id for this example token.

Note that two Issuers could use the same Token ID since the Issuers will have
different Identity Chain IDs. It is up to users to decide which Issuer's token
they wish to use. Trust in an Issuer is necessary to trust the integrity of
future token distribution decisions.


## Addresses

FAT-0 uses Factom's [Factoid
Address](https://github.com/FactomProject/FactomDocs/blob/master/factomDataStructureDetails.md#human-readable-addresses)
key pairs based on ed25519 cryptography to send and receive tokens.


### Reserved Coinbase & Burn Address

The 0th Factoid Address: `FA1y5ZGuHSLmf2TqNf6hVMkPiNGyQpQDTFJvDLRkKQaoPo4bmbgu`
representing a private key with all zeros is a reserved address for minting and
burning tokens.

Only coinbase transactions are allowed from this address, which must be signed
by the identity of the token issuer. Tokens sent to this address are provably
un-spendable (burnt). This address is not allowed to send tokens from its
balance under any circumstance.


## Token Issuance Chain

A Factom chain is used to hold data about the token's issuance.


### Issuance Chain ID `extends` [FATIP-100](100.md)

The Issuance Chain ID can be calculated by using the Issuer's Identity Chain ID
and the Token ID. The Issuance Chain has the following External IDs.

| External ID Index | External ID Value                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 0                 | "token"                                      |
| 1                 | \<Hex Encoded Token ID>                      |
| 2                 | "issuer"                                     |
| 3                 | \<Hex Encoded Issuer Identity Root Chain ID> |

For example, for FAT-0 token `mytoken`:

```
Chain ID = sha256(sha256("token") | sha256("mytoken") | sha256("issuer") | sha256("888888dd9e60c1f0216f753caf5c9b5be4c9ca69db27a6c33d30dce3fe5ee709"))
Chain ID = 0x85ab32f9748bf4c24cedb301bc5a4938eb5cd4a5b0bb46b70027bf983f579a2e
```


### Token Issuance Entry `extends` [FATIP-101](101.md)

A data structure called the Token Issuance holds the information about the
FAT-0 token such as it's name, symbol, supply, and ID.

The official issuance entry is the first well-formed entry on the token's
issuance chain that has a valid signature from the Issuer's SK1 key identified
by the Issuer's Identity Chain. 

There may only be one issuance entry per FAT-0
token. It should be noted that due to the implementation of FATIP-100 in this spec, the signed issuance entry cannot be the first entry in the issuance chain, since it's ExtIDS must be exact. The issuance entry does not have to be the first entry in the chain. Invalid entries are simply ignored.

From FATIP-101, the `idNonce` being signed shall be the `chainID` of the issuance chain concatenated with the entry content, and the `IDKey` used shall be the IDKey of the issuer at the time of entry to Factom.


#### Issuance Entry Content Example

```json
{
  "type": "FAT-0",
  "supply": 10000000,
  "name": "Example Token",
  "symbol": "EXT",
  "salt": "874220a808090fb736f345dd5d67ac26eab94c9c9f51b708b05cdc4d42f65aae",
}
```

Where sha256d is a double round of sha256 hashing: `sha256d(x) =
sha256(sha256(x))`

## Token Transaction Chain

A Factom chain is used to hold the initial distributions and transactions of
the token. The Factom Blockchain provides a fixed ordering of transactions, a
requirement for determining consensus around the state of balances and
transaction validation. Anyone who wishes to make a transaction must create a
well-formed entry with a valid signature on token's transactions chain.


### Transaction Chain ID `extends` [FATIP-100](100.md)

The Transaction Chain ID can be calculated by using the Issuer's Identity Chain
ID and the Token ID. The Issuance Chain has the following External IDs.

| External ID Index | External ID Value                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 0                 | "token"                                      |
| 1                 | \<Hex Encoded Token ID>                      |
| 2                 | "issuer"                                     |
| 3                 | \<Hex Encoded Issuer Identity Root Chain ID> |
| 4                 | "transactions"                               |

For example, for FAT-0 token `mytoken`:

```
Chain ID = sha256(sha256("token") | sha256("mytoken") | sha256("issuer") | sha256("888888dd9e60c1f0216f753caf5c9b5be4c9ca69db27a6c33d30dce3fe5ee709") | sha256("transactions"))
Chain ID = 0x85ab32f9748bf4c24cedb301bc5a4938eb5cd4a5b0bb46b70027bf983f579a2e
```

### Token Transaction Entry `extends` [FATIP-101](101.md)

Token Transaction Entries represent the signed transfer of an amount of FAT-0
tokens from one Factoid address to another.

The order of transactions is solely determined by the order the transaction
entries appear in the transaction chain. Factom provides a locked, time ordered
record of submission for each transaction. The presense of a Transaction Entry
in the chain is necessary but not sufficient for the transaction to be
considered valid. Sufficient balance, valid signatures, as well as some other
requirements to prevent replay attacks are described below.

FAT-0 transactions borrow cryptographic elements from Factoid Transactions,
including it's RCD (Redeem Condition Datastructure) address format, and
signatures. FAT-0 transactions are multi-input, multi-output (MIMO).

For standard transactions, RCDs and corresponding signatures are provided in
the External IDs of the Transaction Entry. For coinbase transactions that
initially distribute tokens, the signatures are provided in the structure of
the entry as described by FATIP-101.

#### Transaction ID

The unique ID of a transaction is its entry hash in the Factom blockchain. This
is a unique hash of all of the data in the content and the External IDs of the
entry.


#### Transaction Entry Content Example

```json
{
    "inputs:": [
        {
            "address": "FA1zT4aFpEvcnPqPCigB3fvGu4Q4mTXY22iiuV69DqE1pNhdF2MC",
            "amount": 100
        },
        {
            "address": "FA2y6VYYPR9Y9Vyy1ZuZqWWRXGXLeuvsLWGkDxq3Ed7yc11dbBKV",
            "amount": 50
        }
    ],

**\* = required for coinbase transaction**


#### External IDs
Transaction Entries must include two External IDs for every input address listed in the transaction: the RCD
that hashes to the corresponding input address, and a signature. 

Implementations should ignore any External IDs after the first `2n`, where `n`
is the number of input addresses with respect to Factoid address signing & verification process. This allows a user to optionally append any additional External IDs.

In the case of coinbase transactions, the last External ID is used to hold a signature of the issuing identity as per [FATIP-101](101.md). The `idNonce` being signed shall be the transaction `chain ID` concatenated with the entry content. The `IDKey` shall be the issuing identity's IDKey at the time of entry into Factom.

In the following table `X` is any even number less than `2n`.

| External ID Index          | External ID Value (RAW DATA)                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0                          | RCD corresponding to `input[0].address`                      |
| 1                          | ed25519 signature by key of RCD in preceding External ID     |
| ...                        |                                                              |
| `X`                        | RCD corresponding to `input[X/2].address`                    |
| `X + 1`                    | ed25519 signature by key of RCD in preceding External ID     |
| `ExtIds[ExtID.length - 1]` | Raw binary ed25519 signature output of signing transaction `chainID` + entry content.  ed25519 signature validation (`chainID`+ entry content, `idKey`, `ExtID[0]`) |



##### Encoding

All of the RCD and Signature External IDs in a Transaction Entry shall be raw
data and not use any encoding. The [Factom Explorer](https://explorer.factom.com/) now properly displays External IDs
that contain raw data as hex encoded data. So there is little reason to encode
the data we put in the External IDs.


##### RCD
The RCD is a data structure that hashes to the payload of a Factoid Address.
The RCD data structure is 33 bytes long. The first byte is the RCD type
(`0x01`), the remaining 32 bytes are a ed25519 public key.

Factoid Addresses contain a header and a checksum, which is described futher in
the [Factom Data Structures
Documentation](https://github.com/FactomProject/FactomDocs/blob/master/factomDataStructureDetails.md#human-readable-addresses).

To validate that an RCD "corresponds" to a Factoid Address,
1. Convert the Factoid Address string from base58 to raw bytes.
2. Remove the first 2 bytes header bytes and the last four bytes checksum
   bytes.
3. The remaining 32 bytes must be the double SHA256 hash of the raw bytes of
   the RCD.


##### Signature
The signature is the same as that used in a [Factoid
Transaction](https://github.com/FactomProject/FactomDocs/blob/master/factomDataStructureDetails.md#factoid-transaction).

From the Factom Documentation:
> - Factoids use Ed25519 with Schnorr signatures.  They have [many
>   benefits](https://ripple.com/uncategorized/curves-with-a-twist/0) over the
>   ECDSA signatures used in Bitcoin.
> - The signatures are enforced to be
>   [canonical](https://github.com/FactomProject/ed25519/blob/master/ed25519.go#L143).
>   This will limit malleability by attackers without the private key.

The signed data shall be the concatenation of the raw bytes of the chain ID and
the content of the entry.

```
signature = ed25519_sign(priv_key, chain_id + entry_content)
```

The chain ID is included to prevent replay attacks across FAT token chains.


### Transaction Validation and State

There are two types of transactions which have slightly different validation
requirements: Normal transactions between Factoid Addresses, and Coinbase
transactions that may only be created by the Issuer of the token.

The main difference between these two types of transactions is that Normal
transactions must have an RCD and signature for each input address used in the
transaction stored in the External IDs of the Transaction Entry, but Coinbase
transactions must contain a valid signature embedded into the JSON.

A Coinbase transaction is identified by whether it has an input from the
Coinbase address: `FA1y5ZGuHSLmf2TqNf6hVMkPiNGyQpQDTFJvDLRkKQaoPo4bmbgu`	

#### Computing the current state
Implementations must maintain the state of the balances of all addresses in
order to evaluate the validity of a transaction. The current state can be built
by iterating through all entries in the Transaction Chain and sequentially
updating the state for any transaction that meets all of the necessary
Transaction Validity Requirements.

The following pseudo code describes how to compute the current state of all
balances. A transaction must be applied entirely or not at all. Entries that
are not valid transactions are simply ignored. Transactions must be evaluated
in the order that they appear in the transaction chain.

```
for entry in transaction_chain.entries:
    if entry.is_valid_transaction():
        if !entry.is_coinbase_transaction():
            for input in entry.inputs:
                balances[input.address] -= input.amount
        for output in entry.outputs:
            balances[output.address] += output.amount
```


#### Transaction Validity Requirements

All Transactions must meet all of the T.x requirements.

Normal Transactions must also meet all of the N.x requirements.

Coinbase Transactions must also meet all of the C.x requirements.

In general, requirements are ordered by the computational and programmatic ease
of checking.

The x.1.x requirements are generally data structure validations.

The x.2.x requirements are generally parsing and other content validations.

The x.3.x requirements are generally related to cryptographic validations.

##### T.x Requirements for all transactions

- T.1.1: The content of the entry must be a single well-formed JSON.
- T.1.2: The JSON must contain all required fields listed in the above table.
- T.1.3: The `inputs` and `outputs` arrays must not be empty.
- T.1.4: The `inputs` and `outputs` arrays must only contain objects with only
  the two required fields listed in the above table, `address` and `amount`.
- T.2.1: All `address` fields in the `inputs` and `outputs` arrays must contain a
  valid human readable public Factoid Address.
- T.2.2: No Factoid Address may be used in more than one input or output. e.g.
  No input or output array with multiple amounts from or to the same address.
No transactions that use an input address in one of the outputs.
- T.2.3: All `amount` fields in the `inputs` and `outputs` arrays must be a
  positive (non-zero) integer.
- T.2.4: The sum of the `amount` field in the `inputs` must be equal to the sum
  of the `amount` field in the `outputs`.

##### N.x Requirements for normal account-to-account transactions

Normal transactions must meet all T.x and N.x requirements.

All references to External ID indexes use `0`-based indexing.

- N.1.1: The entry must contain a minimum of `2n` External IDs, where `n` is
  the length of the `inputs` array.
- N.2.1: The `milliTimestamp` must be within 24 hours of the entry's recorded
  timestamp. In other words, if `entryTimestamp` is the timestamp when the
  entry was recorded into the blockchain, then `milliTimestamp` must be in the
  range `[entryTimestamp - 12 hours, entryTimestamp + 12 hours]`, inclusive.
- N.2.2: The Coinbase address
  (`FA1y5ZGuHSLmf2TqNf6hVMkPiNGyQpQDTFJvDLRkKQaoPo4bmbgu`) may not be used in
  the `address` fields for any `inputs`.
- N.2.3: The `amount` field for all `inputs` must be less than or equal to the
  balance of the respective `address`.
- N.2.4: All signatures in the odd External IDs must be unique across all
  previous valid transactions. Note that requirement N.2.1 allows that
  uniqueness only needs to be checked among valid transactions within the past 12
  hours.
- N.3.1: If `i` is even and within the first `2n` External IDs, then the `i`th External ID must be the raw data of an
  RCD which hashes to the raw data payload of the human readable Factoid
  Address in `inputs[i/2].address`.
- N.3.2: If `i` is odd  and within the first `2n` External IDs, then the `i`th External ID must be the raw data of a
  valid signature of the raw bytes of the chain id bytes prepended to the
  content of the entry, verified against the public key stored in the RCD in the
  `i-1`th External ID.

##### C.x Requirements for Coinbase distribution transactions

Coinbase transactions must meet all T.x and C.x requirements.

- C.1.1: The JSON must contain the `salt` and `idSignature` fields.
- C.1.2: The `inputs` array must contain a single input.
- C.2.1 The value of `inputs[0].address` must equal be to
  `FA1y5ZGuHSLmf2TqNf6hVMkPiNGyQpQDTFJvDLRkKQaoPo4bmbgu`.
- C.2.2: The `amount` plus the sum of all previous Coinbase transactions must
  be less than or equal to `supply` from the Issuance entry.
- C.2.3: The `idSignature` must be unique across all previously valid Coinbase
  transactions.
- C.3.1: The `idSignature` must be a valid signature of `tokenId + salt` by the SK1 key specified by the Issuer's Identity Chain.


# Implementation

Overall the FAT-0 standard on Factom lends itself to being cross platform. Any
client capable of executing HTTP requests to a local or remote Factom node
should be able to implement the standard.

Due to the specific storage and validation aspects of the standard and Factom's
functionality, there are some implementation guidelines recommended.


## Key-Value Storage

For efficiency it is required to store large quantities of key:value data
representing mappings of:

- Transaction Entry hashes **=>** transaction objects
- Transaction indexes(natural order) **=>** Transaction Entry hashes
- Factoid address **=>** token balances

A high performance external key value store like Redis would be ideal for such
purposes. If an external database is not available then a local LevelDB or
Sqlite database would suffice. It's important to defer storage to the disk
instead of memory, as a successful token will have an ever increasing ordered
list of transactions.


## Filtering

It's required to check for and detect duplicate signatures for FAT-0
transactions and issuances. Iteration and search over the entire array of
transactions is infeasible due to scaling requirements. Probabilistic
datastructures such as Bloom Filters offer a space efficient and scalable
solution to this issue with a tunable false-positive rate.

### Bloom Filter Implementation

Bloom filters take in parameters to tune their size and false-positive rate.

- **n** - The number of items in the filter
- **p** - The target false positive rate
- **k** - The number of hash functions to act as buckets

Applying these parameters to an estimation function results in **m**, the total
size of the filter in bits.


For the purposes of FAT-0, the following parameters are recommended:

- **p** - 1 / 1,000,000,000 (1.0E-9)
- **k** - 29.89

At a **n** of 1M signatures this results in a **m** of ~5.2 MB, which is
acceptable when we compare it with the overhead of the alternative. At an **n**
of 1,000,000 the equivalent array/map datastructure would consume ~128 MB not
including iteration overhead which does not scale linearly. Here is a
visualization of how the proposed bloom filter implementation scales:

As the number of transactions increases infinitely, it is possible to readjust
the parameters of the filter to reach an acceptable false positive rate. This
however requires a rebuild of the filter from the transaction database, and
also opens up the possibility of forking. To put the scale required for this
redefinition in perspective, Bitcoin currently has around 333M confirmed
transactions compared to our theoretical **n** of 1M.

With good will and proper salting it's virtually impossible to produce a
duplicate signature. However, malicious actors must be prevented from executing
copy paste replay attacks that can drain accounts within the implementation. As
the filter grows in accuracy towards 100%, the result approaches "ultimate
truth" of the system's state.


## API Stack

A layered API approach is necessary for the protocol to be both truthful and
scalable.

The Factom blockchain holds all of the data for the Factom based FAT-0 tokens.
Entries are locked into Factom Chains representing the transaction and issuance
information for each token. Every 10 Minutes Factom is hashed into the Bitcoin
blockchain to secure it forever.


### Medium Node

Medium nodes maintain a copy of the complete transaction databases of tokens on
a token by token basis. Because of the scale involved, an external operational
database is required to store all the entries. This is the highest level of
truth in the protocol at the expense of size.

Full nodes can run API's to allow other clients lower in the hierarchy access
filtered and parsed token data.


### Light Node

Light nodes maintain a running copy of the complete transaction databases of
tokens on a token by token basis, backed by a full node. Light nodes can run
API's to allow other clients lower in the hierarchy access filtered and parsed
token data. Light nodes can also access the Factom network directly if
necessary.


### Client

Clients can use either a medium or light node to access data about FAT-0
tokens. This is usually embedded in a webpage, or mobile device, or other
application that needs to be light weight.


## Private or Encrypted Tokens

Private tokens are useful for conducting private development and testing, internal usage tokens, and creating permissioned token systems. Issuance and Transaction content can be encrypted using symmetric or asymmetric encryption to restrict access and operation to key holders. It's also possible to use asymmetric cryptography via PGP and similar methods.


## Compression

Issuance and Transaction content can be compressed to save on the cost of Entry
Credits and reduce bloat on the Factom blockchain. In many cases transaction
entries are pushed over the boundary from 1EC (<=1KB) to 2EC (>1KB <= 2KB) in
cost due to a couple hundred extra bytes. Using an effective compression
algorithm that balances size savings and speed addresses this and can reduce
the EC cost of transactions by half.
