FATIP proposals are a open collection of tokenized asset standards built on the Factom blockchain, known as Factom Asset Token standards (FAT) standards. This is the central location for collaboration on the technical aspects of the FAT project and where standard proposals can be submitted for adoption and acceptance into the ecosystem.
