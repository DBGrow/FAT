# Summary

This standard describes a method of publishing WebAssembly(WASM) bytecode to a Factom chain. This standard is used in conjunction with specialized FATIP-0 transactions to specify and establish contracts at Factoid addresses. Contracts resolve to a unique Factom Chain Id.

# Motivation

Our [proof of concept](https://github.com/Factom-Asset-Tokens/wasm-contract-poc) successfully demonstrated that raw WASM bytecode could successfully be stored published and interpreted from the External Ids of Factom entry. While effective, this simple system created a hard limit of 10KB in contract size as it used a single entry.

This standard provides a simple method to publish contract bytecode, or more generically any byte buffer to Factom using sequential entries in on a dedicated chain.

Allowing contract code to have a dedicated chain allows reuse of established and vetted contracts. For example, an escrow contract established by a law firm could be implemented directly by multiple different FAT tokens & contracts at their addresses by specifying the chain Id of the contracts compiled source code.

# Specification

## Publication Chain

A single Factom chain is used to hold all of the data about the contract.

## Initial Publication Entry

The initial entry in the publication chain describes and sums up the contents and interface for the contract that will occur in the following entries. It's important to ensure the contract buffer is properly interpreted from the entries in its entirety, otherwise is deemed invalid.

Note that the contracts content determines it's unique Factom chain ID.

### Initial Publication Entry Content Example

```json
{
  "bytes": 999,
  "abi":{
      "_add":{
          "args":[
              "number",
              "number"
          ],
          "returns":"number"
      }
  }
  "metadata": {"contract-name": "example contract"}
}
```

### Initial Publication Entry External Ids

| Index | Description                                                  | Encoding | Validation                                 | Required |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------- |

| 1     | The 64 Byte sha512 output of the full buffer                 | raw      | 64 Bytes in length                         | N        |

### Application Binary Interface

The ABI is a datastructure that defines how the higher level smart contract platform interfaces with the low level binary WASM code. At it's heart a WASM VM is a very low level machine which needs help understanding how to interpret more complex types like strings from the host environment, and vice versa.

#### Supported Arguments and Return Types

- `i32` - 32 Bit integer
- `i64` - 64 Bit integer
- `f32` - 32 Bit float
- `f64` - 64 Bit float
- `string` - `i32` pointer to an array of null terminated character bytes in linear memory
- `array[i32]` -  `i32` pointer to an array of `i32` bytes in linear memory
- `array[i64]` -  `i32` pointer to an array of `i64` bytes in linear memory
- `array[f32]` -  `i32` pointer to an array of `f32` bytes in linear memory
- `array[f32]` -  `i32` pointer to an array of `f64` bytes in linear memory



## Publication Entry

The subsequent entries on the publication chain hold the remainder of the byte buffer

Normal publication entries have no content.

### Publication Entry External Ids

| Index | Description                                                  | Encoding | Required |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------- |
| 0     | The next 10K Bytes the buffer, or the concluding Bytes of the buffer | raw      | Y        |
|       |                                                              |          |          |

## Contract Publication Validation

To validate the contract buffer:

1. Retrieve the Initial Publication Entry of the contract chain
2. Check that the Initial Publication Entry content and External Ids match the validation expected of a initial publication entry
3. Read subsequent Publication Entries, concatenating bytes from the 0th External ID while:
   1. Subsequent entries satisfy the Publication Entry validation
   2. The number of bytes in the buffer is less than `bytes` specified in the initial Publication Entry
4. Validate that the number of Bytes in the final buffer matches what is expected in `bytes`
5. Validate that the sha512 hash of the final buffer matches what was specified in the Initial Publication Entry
6. Validate that the buffer represents a valid WASM binary



# Implementation

The official [WebAssembly Toolkit (WABT)](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt)'s [wasm-validate](https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/doc/wasm-validate.1.html) command line tool is a very popular way of validating WASM binaries.
